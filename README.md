# Unity Utilities

Some utilities and other things I usually need and ended up writing again and again when using Unity.

## [Pooling Utility](./Analyzers/Pooling/README.md)

Use the [Pooled] attribute on any instantiatable class to add static methods that handles pooling! It uses Unity's own [pooling solution](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html).
